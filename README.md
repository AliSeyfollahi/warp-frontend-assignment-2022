# Warp Assignment for frontenders

The goal of this assignment is to get an idea of your knowledge and experience with the Javascript / Frontend technology that is present in our stack.

The assignment consists of an initial working app that you will extend with new features or styling.

The goal is to get an idea of your skills and approach. So please pick the parts of the assignment that you are comfortable to take on by yourself.

## Tasks

The app is a simple Todo list. On the roadmap are the following new features that you can implement as part of the assignment:

- Add (themed) styling to the application with the use of an styling library
- Add a checkmark to each item to reflect the state of the item (incomplete / complete). Clicking on the checkmark should toggle the state
- Sort the list according to the state of each item (incompletes first)
- Add the ability to add a due date to each item and sort the incomplete items by due date

## Getting started

## Technology
